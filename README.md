# Deep Supervised Hash 
This repo contains my implementation of deep supervised hashing on MNIST. My methodology roughly follows the paper [Deep supervised hashing for fast image retrieval (2016)](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Liu_Deep_Supervised_Hashing_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf).
